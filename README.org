Pipe content between your terminal and Emacs buffers - seamlessly bridge your command-line workflows with your editor.

* What?

~mxp~ is a shell script that acts as a bridge between Unix pipes and Emacs buffers. It supports:

- *Write mode*: Pipe stdin to Emacs buffers (creates new or appends to existing)
- *Read mode*: Output buffer content to stdout for piping
- *Streaming*: Real-time content updates with chunked processing
- *Buffer matching*: Use exact names or regex patterns to find buffers
- *Auto-generation*: Creates ~*Piper 1*~, ~*Piper 2*~, etc. when no name specified
- *Pass-through*: Acts like ~tee~ - content flows through to stdout
- *Conflict handling*: Avoids overwriting buffers unless forced

The script works with both bash and zsh, handles special characters properly, and includes comprehensive error handling.

* Why?

- Pipe command output directly into Emacs buffers for comfortable viewing
- Stream logs in real-time to watch them in your editor
- Extract buffer content from Emacs and pipe it to terminal commands

*** Did you know about piping in Eshell?

Emacs has piping in/out buffers in Eshell! You can pipe content into a buffer like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; In eshell, you can pipe command output to a buffer 
;; You can press <C-c M-b> to pick a buffer instead of typing it

cat file.txt > #<buffer some-buffer> 
#+end_src

Unfortunately, Eshell doesn't support input redirection, so reading from a buffer ain't so straightforward, yet still possible. You just need to create a custom eshell command to read from a buffer, e.g.:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; note the eshell/ prefix
(defun eshell/b (buf-or-regexp)
  "Output buffer content of buffer matching BUF-OR-REGEXP."
  (let ((buf (if (bufferp buf-or-regexp)
                 buf-or-regexp
               (cl-loop for b in (buffer-list)
                        thereis (and (string-match-p
                                      buf-or-regexp (buffer-name b))
                                     b)))))
    (when buf
      (with-current-buffer buf
        (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max))))))
#+end_src

And then we can use it in Eshell:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Press <C-c M-b> to pick a buffer instead of typing it

b #<buffer README.org> | rg "error"
#+end_src

Incredibly powerful, but this only works *inside* Eshell - you cannot use it in an external terminal. ~mxp~ brings this same workflow to your regular shell, letting you pipe between *any* terminal and Emacs. 

* How?

** Make sure you have:

- Emacs with ~emacsclient~ (Emacs daemon must be running)
- bash or zsh
- Standard Unix utilities (~base64~, ~grep~, ~sed~)

** Install

Download and put it somewhere in the $PATH
 #+begin_src shell
 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agzam/mx-piper/refs/heads/main/mxp -o \
     ~/.local/bin/mxp \
     && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/mxp 
  #+end_src

Make sure Emacs daemon is running and emacsclient works!

** Use

*** Open files and directories in Emacs

#+begin_src shell
# Open a file
mxp my-file.txt
mxp README.org

# Open current directory in dired
mxp .

# Open any directory
mxp ~/Projects
mxp /path/to/directory

# Works with relative paths
mxp ../other-project/file.txt
#+end_src

*** Pipe command output into Emacs

#+begin_src shell
# Pipe to a named buffer
cat file.txt | mxp "my-buffer"

# Pipe to auto-generated buffer (*Piper 1*, *Piper 2*, etc.)
tail -f /var/log/app.log | mxp

# Append to existing buffer
echo "more content" | mxp --append "my-buffer"
echo "more content" | mxp -a "my-buffer"

# Prepend to existing buffer (insert at the top)
echo "header info" | mxp --prepend "my-buffer"
echo "header info" | mxp -p "my-buffer"

# Match buffer by regex
echo "data" | mxp "mybuf.*"

# Force overwrite existing buffer
cat new.txt | mxp --force "my-buffer"
cat new.txt | mxp -F "my-buffer"
#+end_src

*** Extract buffer content and pipe to commands

#+begin_src shell
# Output buffer to stdout
mxp --from "my-buffer"
mxp -f "my-buffer"

# Pipe buffer to commands
mxp --from "*Messages*" | grep error
mxp -f ".*scratch.*" | wc -l

# Use in command chains
mxp -f "my-buffer" | sort | uniq | less
#+end_src

*** Pass-through behavior

Content flows through to stdout, so you can continue piping:

#+begin_src shell
# Capture to buffer AND pass through
cat data.txt | mxp "backup" | grep important | mxp "filtered"
#+end_src

*** Process substitution

Works naturally with process substitution for commands expecting files:

#+begin_src shell
# Compare two buffers
diff <(mxp -f "version-1") <(mxp -f "version-2")

# Use buffer as input file
jq . <(mxp -f "*json-data*")
#+end_src

** Emacs Hook

You can define a hook in your Emacs config to run custom logic when buffers are created:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-mxp-hook (buffer-name)
  "Custom logic when mxp creates a buffer."
  (with-current-buffer buffer-name
    ;; Auto-enable certain modes, format content, etc.
    (when (string-match ".*\\.json.*" buffer-name)
      (json-mode)
      (json-pretty-print-buffer))))

(setq mxp-buffer-hook #'my-mxp-hook)
#+end_src

** Examples

#+begin_src shell
# Quick file/directory access
mxp config.json          # Open config file
mxp .                    # Browse current directory in dired
mxp ~/Documents          # Open Documents folder

# Watch build logs in Emacs
npm run build | mxp "build-logs"

# Capture git diff for review
git diff | mxp "review"

# Send curl output to Emacs for inspection
curl -s "https://api.thedogapi.com/v1/breeds" | jq | mxp "breeds"
# and the the opposite direction:
mxp "breeds" | jq '.[].name' | sort | mxp "dog names"

# Extract TODO items from buffer
mxp -f "*scratch*" | grep TODO > todos.txt

# Add timestamps to the top of a log buffer
date | mxp --prepend "logs"
tail -f app.log | mxp --append "logs"

# Pipe multiple buffers together
cat <(mxp -f "header") <(mxp -f "body") | mail -s "Report" user@example.com

# Edit a file, then pipe its buffer content through a command
mxp config.yaml                           # Opens in Emacs
mxp -f config.yaml | yq '.version' -      # Read it back
#+end_src
